# Comparative Analysis of Deep Generative Models

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation and evaluation of three major deep generative modeling paradigms on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP).

## Project Overview

This project investigates the performance characteristics and trade-offs of different generative modeling approaches through systematic experimentation. It provides a comprehensive framework to:
- Compare generative model architectures and training dynamics
- Evaluate sample quality using multiple quantitative metrics
- Analyze computational efficiency and training stability
- Conduct ablation studies on key hyperparameters
- Visualize generation quality and training progression

## Key Findings

- **WGAN-GP with Spectral Normalization** achieved the best balance of sample quality and training stability
- **Deep DC-GAN** produced the highest quality samples (IS: 6.4±0.2) but showed occasional training instability
- **VAE** demonstrated superior mode coverage (0.89) and fastest inference speed but with some sample blurriness
- **Learning rate of 0.0002** emerged as optimal across all model types
- **Latent dimension of 128** provided the best quality-efficiency trade-off
- **Spectral normalization** consistently improved training stability without sacrificing quality

# Comprehensive Comparison of Generative Models: DC-GAN, WGAN-GP, and VAE

This repository contains a systematic implementation and evaluation of three major generative modeling approaches on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets using PyTorch: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DC-GAN), Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

## Project Overview

This project investigates the performance characteristics and trade-offs between different generative modeling paradigms through comprehensive experimentation. The study provides:
- Systematic comparison of generative model architectures and training dynamics
- Evaluation of sample quality using multiple quantitative metrics (FID, IS, Diversity)
- Analysis of computational efficiency and training stability
- Extensive hyperparameter optimization studies
- Statistical validation through multiple independent runs
- Practical recommendations for model selection

## Key Findings

- **WGAN-GP** achieved the best sample quality (FID: 71.2 on MNIST, 174.6 on CIFAR-10) with superior training stability
- **DC-GAN** provided excellent quality-speed balance (FID: 77.4 on MNIST, 181.5 on CIFAR-10) with reasonable training time
- **VAE** demonstrated fastest training (3-6x faster) but with lower sample quality
- **Learning rate optimization** proved more impactful than architectural changes (15-25% performance difference)
- **Optimal hyperparameters**: DC-GAN (lr=0.0002), WGAN-GP (lr=0.0001), VAE (lr=0.001)
- **Batch size flexibility**: Minimal impact on performance (<2% difference), enabling GPU memory optimization

## Model Architectures

### DC-GAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
- **Generator**: 4-layer transposed CNN with batch normalization (100D noise → 32×32×3 images)
- **Discriminator**: 4-layer CNN with LeakyReLU and batch normalization
- **Training**: Binary cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer (β₁=0.5, β₂=0.999)
- **Architecture**: Standard DCGAN following Radford et al. (2015) guidelines

### WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty)
- **Generator**: Identical to DC-GAN generator architecture
- **Critic**: Modified discriminator with LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm (no final sigmoid)
- **Training**: Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (λ=10), critic trained 5x per generator update
- **Optimizer**: Adam with β₁=0.0, β₂=0.9 as recommended

### VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
- **Encoder**: CNN with reparameterization trick (128D latent space)
- **Decoder**: Transposed CNN for image reconstruction
- **Training**: ELBO loss (reconstruction MSE + KL divergence)
- **Architecture**: Symmetric encoder-decoder with convolutional layers

## Features

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**: Measures similarity between real and generated image distributions

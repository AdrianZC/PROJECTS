    "The Pima Indians, also known as the Akimel O’odham, are a Native American tribe predominantly residing in the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona, USA. This community has received attention in the realm of public health due to a high prevalence of diabetes, both Type-I and Type-II, among its members. Researchers have long been intrigued by the unusually high rates of diabetes within this population, leading to extensive studies aimed at understanding the factors contributing to this health issue. (Schulz & Chaudhari, 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key factors under investigation is the impact of the number of pregnancies on the likelihood of adult women, specifically those aged 21 and above, developing diabetes. Previous research studies, including the one by Akshay Dattatray Khare, have suggested a potential link between the number of pregnancies a woman experiences and her susceptibility to diabetes (Khare, 2022). Pregnancy induces significant hormone changes in a woman’s body, which can influence insulin sensitivity. For Pima Indian women, exploring this relationship is of particular interest due to the higher prevalence of diabetes in their community. \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this relationship, researchers often rely on comprehensive datasets that include information on the number of pregnancies, diabetes status, genetic factors, lifestyle choices and other relevant variables. Analyzing such data sets, like the one available on Kaggle, provides a valuable opportunity to explore the correlation between the number of pregnancies and the likelihood of diabetes in Pima Indian women.(Khare, 2022) By conducting a rigorous analysis of this data, researchers aim to contribute meaningful insights to the field of public health, potentially paving the way for more effective diabetes prevention tailored specifically to these Pima Indian women. (Khare, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have found a link between Gestational diabetes and pregnancies. They have studied this link by assessing factors such as glucose levels, insulin resistance, lifestyle choices and BMI during and after pregnancy. (Gestational diabetes and pregnancy, 2022) Other researchers, including Eoin Noctor, have shown that they also focus on glucose levels as well. He also talked about the heterogeneity of risk factors, including pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at diagnosis, and ethnicity, contributing to the understanding of the progression to type 2 diabetes post-GDM (Noctor, 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use these same variables in our data as some of the researchers we have seen have done, with one response variable and 8 explanatory variables. We decided to put gestational diabetes and type II diabetes in the same discussion because both conditions can impact maternal and fetal health. Researching them together helps in understanding the shared consequences, complications, and potential interventions to improve outcomes for both mothers and infants.\n",

Thus, we want to collect data from the population of Pima Indian heritage whose age is above 20 years old, either have the pregnancy experience or not, with all their data that corresponds to our variables.

However, our Diabetes dataset was first created in 2015. So we don't know how many times it has been updated and whether the current version is the most recent one. 2. This dataset didn't specify which type it was focusing on. So in our project, we assumed it is Type-II Diabetes. This decision is based on the research that: Type-II diabetes is a common condition in the adult population while Type-I diabetes is a common condition in the whole population(included children). 3. Our Gestational diabetes dataset didn't specify the population of people they were focusing on. But our data is collected in 2022, which is very closed to the current society. It can help us make pediction that closed enough to the current social situation regarding the risk of getting diabetes for adult women. 4. We want to determine the relationship of the level of Sys BP and the outcome of gestational diabetes. But most data of the column 'Sys BP' is missed, we need to give it up at this point. We cannot just replace those NaN value to 0 or remove them from the dataset, otherwise it will lead to an very biased result which we don't want.    \n"

According to the relationship of (Age and BMI) and (Number of Pregnancies and BMI) from both of them, we can predict whether the higher BMI is associated with the older age, whether the higher BMI is also associated with the greater number of Pregnancies, and whether the higher BMI is associated with both of them. Besides, to determine whether the higher level of hypertension and of homoglobin is associated with the prediabetes, and whether pregnant women with prediabetes were successfully get rid of the gestational diabetes. According to this conclusion, with connected to the relationship of Number of Pregnancies and the Outcome of Diabetes/Gestational Diabetes, we can see: whether the number of Pregnancies will lead to the higher (BMI, bloodpresure, and Homoglobin) and thus increasing the probability of getting Diabetes/Gestational Diabetes. If the classification error for prediabetes and gestational diabetes is extremely low and the barplot for them is highly similar, then we can conlude: prediabetes leads to gestational diabetes and most pregnant women didn't have good habits on monitoring their health conditons. If the relationship of Number of Pregnancies and Diabetes is similar to the relationship of Number of Pregnancies and Gestational Diabetes, we can also determine: whether the higher/lower probability of getting Gestational Diabetes will lead to the higher/lower probability of getting Diabetes.

    "To uphold ethics and privacy in our project, our group used a dataset that was available online for public use. The dataset was originally from Kaggle, in which the author disclosed that the data were obtained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n",
    "The obtained dataset and our research question focus on a specific group of people, female Pima Indians above age 21, which excludes all other populations. We will ensure not to use this data to make conclusions about the general population, and rather, focus on what the data says about the given sample population. \n",
    "Further, the sensitive health data may also raise ethical considerations such as privacy and security. The topic covers sensitive issues, such as factors possibly indicative of diabetes. However, the dataset did not contain any personally identifiable information, and the primary focus of obtaining the data was informative, to predict if the patient has diabetes based on objective factors. This ensures that we are unable to identify any participants in this dataset, keeping their information private and secure.\n",
    "Lastly, we ensure not to make any harmful causative conclusions, such as “more pregnancies leads to diabetes,” as this communicates false information that does not take into account the different causes of diabetes. Instead, we intend to focus on the correlation between pregnancy and diabetes. \n",
